### <font color="green"> <span style="font-size:larger;"> Contents of Binary Classification: </font> </span>

Here after a brief description of the contents of the folder.   
For each design and training an analyis of the results in terms of Confusion Matrices and Roc Curves is reported.

- **task_binary_1.ipynb**:
    - it contains the code to design a **from-scratch CNN** used to classify between mass and calcification patches in a set of mammography images. 
- **task_binary_2.ipynb**:
    - it contains the code to design a **pre-trained CNN** used to classify between mass and calcification patches in a set of mammography images. 
 - **task_binary_3.ipynb**:
    - it contains the code to design a **Two-channel CNN** used to classify between mass and calcification patches in a set of mammography images, exploitin benign tissue images.
- **task_binary_4.ipynb**:
    - it contains the code to design a **CNN** using only baseline patches to detect between mass and calcification; please note this was a trail test to verifiy if the baseline patches are correlated to the correspondant malign patches and therefore can be used to improve the classification.

All the files are written in python language as part of Jupiter Collab notebook (please remember that the code is copyrighted by UniversitaÂ´di Pisa).   
In each cell you can visualize the obtained result. Please seutp workspace and collab notebook to run locally the codes.
